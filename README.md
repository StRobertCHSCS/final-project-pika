#### The Obejective of this game is that using our player Pikachu, we travel and jump in the world of Pokemons, going through obstacles in order to collect all the coins. I have used Tiled Map Editor in order to create the tiles present in the game so Pikachu can jump on different tiles and collect coins. The point of playing this game is to help Pikachu to jump on different tiles by pressing keyboard buttons (arrows on the keyboard) and reach the highest height of the game and collect all the coins. After collecting all the coins Pikachu will simply reach the end point and the game will finish.

#### Pressing on up key results in Pikachu jumping and going up of the tiles. Left and right keys simply allow Pikachu to go to the directions of left and right. The user will have to push on the right key in order to help Pikachu move forward. Pikachu will have to use the lowest tiles in order to be able to get to the highest point of the game to collect all the coins. He would jump on tiles and steps in order to collect coins and reach the end point.

## Scoring

#### Scoring in this game takes place by collecting the coins. The user will help Pikachu to move forward and jump on different tiles in order to collect the coins and reavh the end pint.
